<h1># revrbe-better-memory</h1>

Functional memory header for opening handle, getting modules and read/writing to process.

Currently it is using NtOpenProcess to open a handle to csgo.exe and XOR encryption on memory read/write with randomized XOR key on each run.

Was too bored to implement any actual cheat features, but tested with simple bunny-hop and it works fine.

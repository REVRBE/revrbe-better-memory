<h1># revrbe-better-memory</h1>

Functional memory header for opening handle, getting modules and read/writing to process. Currently it is using NtOpenProcess to open a handle to csgo.exe and XOR encryption on memory read/write with randomized XOR key. 

<h2>Usage</h2>

Implement your own cheat features and boom, it's a functional cheat.

<b>Warning:</b> This is for educational purposes only. Using this in-game might result in a ban. Use at your own risk!

<h3>Personal Note</h3>

Was too bored to implement any actual cheat features, but tested with simple bunny-hop and it works fine.
